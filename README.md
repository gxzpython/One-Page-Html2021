# One-Page-Html2021 -🏙 Real Estate Broker Index Page 🏙

## Mini one-page project

This mini project is about building one index page of a website. It is an excersice of what we learned in html css. 



#About this Website: 
  This is a index website of a real estate broker company. It will guide the user or the client of the company to check all the available houses in the market. each house has detailed infomation attached.
 

#How to run the project:

Save all the documents in one directory and open the html document in the file with any IDE or default web browser.

#Challenges in this project:

1.the structure was not well-sized, lots of unneccessary margin appeared in the website when i zoom out the page. Fixed with adding footer and header in css style document
2.The body part is kind hard to seprate the houses evenly when I use li. Fixed with the div class ='row'

#Update in the future:
1. add company logo in the header as a back ground.
2. add each responsible agent under the house detail and add link for the agent's own website
3. add search bar in the navigation bar
4. make the body larger to do this might adding one more row of houses
5. update the back ground make the website looks fancier
