# One-Page-Html2021 -🏙 Real Estate Broker Index Page 🏙

## Mini one-page project

This mini project is about building one index page of a website. It is an excersice of what we learned in html css. 


## 🥸🥸About this Website🥸🥸: 

This is a index website of a real estate broker company. It will guide the user or the client of the company to create personal account in the website , check all the available houses in the market,save favorite houses and contact the agents if they have any questions. Each house has detailed infomation attached.
 
 
## 🧐🧐How to run the project🧐🧐:

Save all the documents in one directory and open the html document in the file with any IDE or default web browser.


## 🤯🤯Challenges in this project🤯🤯:

1.the structure was not well-sized, lots of unneccessary margin appeared in the website when i zoom out the page. Fixed with adding footer and header in css style document
2.The body part is kind hard to seprate the houses evenly when I use li. Fixed with the div class ='row'


## 🚀🚀Update in the future🚀🚀:
1🆙. add company logo in the header as a back ground.

2🆙. add each responsible agent under the house detail and add link for the agent's own website

3🆙. add search bar in the navigation bar

4🆙. make the body larger to do this might adding one more row of houses

5🆙. update the back ground make the website looks fancier
